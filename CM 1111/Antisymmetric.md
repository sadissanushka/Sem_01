### **Antisymmetric: Definition, Example, and Non-example**

**Definition:**  
A **relation R** on a set **A** is **antisymmetric** if **for all a, b in A**,  
**if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, a) ∈ R**, then **a must be equal to b**.

In other words, **both (a, b) and (b, a)** can only exist **if a = b**.

---

**Example:**  
Let **A = {1, 2, 3}**  
Relation **R = { (1,1), (2,2), (1,2) }**

This is **antisymmetric** because:

- (1,2) is in R, but (2,1) is **not**, so it's okay
    
- (1,1) and (2,2) are fine since a = b  
    No pair of distinct elements (a ≠ b) appears with both (a,b) and (b,a)

**Non-example:**  
Let **A = {1, 2, 3}**  
Relation **R = { (1,2), (2,1) }**

This is **not antisymmetric** because:

- (1,2) and (2,1) are both in R, **but 1 ≠ 2**  
    So it **violates** antisymmetry.
