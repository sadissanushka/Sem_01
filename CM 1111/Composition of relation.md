### **Composition of Relations (R ∘ S or R.S)**

**Definition:**  
The **composition of two relations** **R** and **S**, written as **R ∘ S** (read “R after S”), relates **a to c** if there exists **b** such that:

**(a, b) ∈ S** and **(b, c) ∈ R**  
So, **(a, c) ∈ R ∘ S**

---

### **Example:**

Let  
**Set A = {1, 2, 3}**  
**Relation S = { (1,2), (2,3) }**  
**Relation R = { (2,4), (3,5) }**

Now, we find **R ∘ S**:  
Look for pairs where the second element of **S** matches the first element of **R**.

- From **S: (1,2)** and **R: (2,4)** → **(1,4) ∈ R ∘ S**
    
- From **S: (2,3)** and **R: (3,5)** → **(2,5) ∈ R ∘ S**
    

**So, R ∘ S = { (1,4), (2,5) }**

### **Visual Tip:**

Think of **R ∘ S** like two steps:  
**a → b (via S), then b → c (via R)**, so overall: **a → c**
