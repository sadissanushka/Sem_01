### **Reflexive: Definition, Example, and Non-example**

**Definition:**  
A **reflexive relation** on a set is a relation where **every element is related to itself**.  
In formal terms:  
A relation **R** on a set **A** is reflexive if for **every element a in A**, the pair **(a, a)** is in R.

**Example:**

Let **A = {1, 2, 3}**  
Relation **R = { (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,2) }**

This is **reflexive** because it contains (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3)—every element is related to itself.

---

**Non-example:**

Let **A = {1, 2, 3}**  
Relation **R = { (1,2), (2,2), (3,1) }**

This is **not reflexive** because it **does not contain (1,1)** and **(3,3)**—not every element is related to itself.
