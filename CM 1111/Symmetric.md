### **Symmetric: Definition, Example, and Non-example**

**Definition:**  
A **symmetric relation** on a set means that **if an element a is related to b, then b is also related to a**.  
Formally:  
A relation **R** on a set **A** is symmetric if **for all a, b in A**,  
if **(a, b) ∈ R**, then **(b, a) ∈ R**.

**Example:**  
Let **A = {1, 2, 3}**  
Relation **R = { (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (1,1) }**

This is **symmetric** because:

- (1,2) is matched with (2,1)
    
- (2,3) is matched with (3,2)
    
- (1,1) is its own mirror, so it satisfies symmetry

**Non-example:**  
Let **A = {1, 2, 3}**  
Relation **R = { (1,2), (2,3), (3,2) }**

This is **not symmetric** because:

- (1,2) is in R, but (2,1) is **missing**
