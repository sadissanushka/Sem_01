### **Transitive: Definition, Example, and Non-example**

**Definition:**
A **relation R** on a set **A** is **transitive** if for all **a, b, c ∈ A**,
whenever **(a, b) ∈ R** and **(b, c) ∈ R**, then **(a, c) ∈ R** must also be in R.

---

**Example:**
Let **A = {1, 2, 3}**
Relation **R = { (1,2), (2,3), (1,3) }**

This is **transitive** because:

* (1,2) and (2,3) are in R
* Therefore, (1,3) is also in R

---

**Non-example:**
Let **A = {1, 2, 3}**
Relation **R = { (1,2), (2,3) }**

This is **not transitive** because:

* (1,2) and (2,3) are in R
* But **(1,3)** is **missing**
