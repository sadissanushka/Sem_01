[[Code Compiling]]
## 🧰 Compiled vs 🎙️ Interpreted Languages

### 🧩 What’s the Difference?

Programming languages can be categorized based on **how they execute code**:

---

### 🧰 Compiled Languages

🔧 **How it works**:
The code is translated **once** by a **compiler** into machine code **before** running.

🧠 **Key Points**:

* Faster at runtime ⚡
* Needs compilation step before execution 🏗️
* Errors are shown all at once 🛑

📦 **Examples**:

* C / C++
* Rust 🦀
* Go 🌀
* Java (partially compiled to bytecode ☕)

---

### 🎙️ Interpreted Languages

🎬 **How it works**:
The code is executed **line by line** by an **interpreter** at runtime.

🧠 **Key Points**:

* Slower than compiled (usually) 🐢
* Easier to test and debug 🔍
* Great for scripting and learning 👶

📦 **Examples**:

* Python 🐍
* JavaScript 🌐
* Ruby 💎
* PHP 🐘

### ⚖️ Comparison Table

| Feature          | 🧰 Compiled                  | 🎙️ Interpreted      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Translation Time | Before execution 🕒          | During execution ⏱️  |
| Speed            | Faster ⚡                     | Slower 🐢            |
| Portability      | Needs recompilation 🧳       | Easily portable 🌍   |
| Error Checking   | At compile-time ❌            | At runtime ⚠️        |
| Use Case         | Performance-critical apps 🎮 | Scripting/web dev 🧪 |

### 🧪 Hybrid Languages

Some languages use **both compilation and interpretation**:

* ☕ **Java**: Compiled to bytecode ➡️ interpreted by JVM
* 🔺 **Python (with .pyc)**: Compiled to bytecode ➡️ run by Python VM
