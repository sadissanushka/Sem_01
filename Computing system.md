### 🧩 Components of a Computing System

#### 🧠 1. **Hardware**

* 💾 **Memory ([[RAM]], [[ROM/Disk]])** – Temporarily or permanently stores data.
* 🧮 **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** – Executes instructions.
* 🖴 **Storage Devices** – HDDs, SSDs for long-term storage.
* 🔌 **Input Devices** – Keyboard, mouse, scanner.
* 📺 **Output Devices** – Monitor, printer, speaker.
* 🧱 **Motherboard** – Connects and integrates all hardware.
* [[Buses]]

#### 🧑‍💻 2. **Software**

* 🧵 **System Software** – OS (e.g., Windows, Linux), device drivers.
* 📦 **Application Software** – Word processors, browsers, games.
* 🛠️ **Utilities** – Backup tools, antivirus, file compressors.

#### 🌐 3. **Network**

* 🌍 Connects computing systems for data sharing.
* 🔄 Supports communication via LAN, WAN, Internet.

### 🔁 Working Principle of a Computer System

1. ⌨️ **Input** – User provides data via input devices.
2. 🧠 **Processing** – CPU processes the data.
3. 💾 **Storage** – Data may be stored temporarily or permanently.
4. 📤 **Output** – Results are displayed via output devices.
5. 🔁 **Feedback/Control** – System may repeat or modify actions based on results.
