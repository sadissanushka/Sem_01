## 🧠 Programming Fundamentals

Welcome to the foundation of programming! This note focuses on building **core thinking skills** that every great programmer needs: **Problem Solving** and **Computational Thinking**.

---

### 🧩 Problem Solving

> The art of breaking down challenges into manageable parts and finding logical solutions.

#### 🔍 Key Concepts: 

* **Understand the problem**: Read carefully, identify input/output.
* **Break it down**: Divide into sub-problems.
* **Plan a strategy**: Choose brute force, greedy, divide and conquer, etc.
* **Pseudocode**: Outline solution before coding.
* **Debug systematically**: Use tools, logs, test cases.

#### 🛠️ Problem-Solving Techniques:

* Trial and Error
* Working Backwards
* Pattern Recognition
* Algorithmic Thinking

#### 🧪 Practice Ideas:

* Solve puzzles like Sudoku, logic games.
* Code on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces.

### 🧮 Computational Thinking

> A method of problem-solving that involves expressing problems and solutions in a way a computer could execute.

#### 🧱 Key Components:

* **Decomposition** 🧩: Break a problem into smaller chunks.
* **Pattern Recognition**📊 : Spot similarities and trends.
* **Abstraction** 🧼: Remove unnecessary detail to focus on what's important.
* **Algorithms** 📜: Step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.

#### 📘 Example Exercise:

> Design a program to recommend movies based on age.

* **Decompose**: Input age, filter by rating, return list.
* **Recognize pattern**: PG for <13, PG-13 for <18, etc.
* **Abstract**: Don't worry about movie names at first.
* **Algorithm**:

  1. Get user age
  2. Filter movies by allowed ratings
  3. Display result
