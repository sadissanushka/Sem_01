## 🧭 Flowcharts & Symbols

Flowcharts are **visual representations of algorithms** or processes. They help you **plan, understand, and communicate** your code or logic before writing actual code.

### 🌀 What is a Flowchart?

A **flowchart** is a diagram that shows the **step-by-step flow of a process or algorithm** using various symbols connected by arrows.

**Why use flowcharts?**

- ✅ Easy to understand
- ✅ Helps visualize logic
- ✅ Great for planning code

### 🧩 Common Flowchart Symbols

| Symbol | Name                       | Meaning                                                            |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🕳️    | **Terminator (Start/End)** | Marks the **beginning or end** of the flow                         |
| ⬜      | **Process**                | Represents an **action** or **step**                               |

|        | **Input/Output**           | Shows **input (e.g. user data)** or **output (e.g. print result)** |
| ➡️     | **Arrow**                  | Indicates the **direction of flow** between steps                  |

### 🖼️ Example Flowchart (Text Version)

Let's say we want to create a flowchart to check if a number is even or odd:

```
🕳️ Start
⬜ Input number
♦️ Is number % 2 == 0?
  ├─ Yes → ⬜ Print "Even"
  └─ No  → ⬜ Print "Odd"
🕳️ End
```

### 🧠 Tips for Drawing Flowcharts

- Use **consistent symbols**.
- Keep it **left-to-right** or **top-to-bottom**.
- Limit decisions to **yes/no** when possible.
- Test your flowchart like code.
