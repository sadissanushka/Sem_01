### 1. **Basic Components**

* **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**

  * Control Unit (CU)
  * Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
  * Registers
* **Memory**

  * RAM (Volatile)
  * ROM (Non-volatile)
* **I/O Devices**
* **System Bus**

  * Data Bus
  * Address Bus
  * Control Bus

* Decimal
* Hexadecimal
* Conversions

---

### 4. **Data Representation**

* Signed & Unsigned Numbers
* Twoâ€™s Complement
* Floating Point Representation (IEEE 754)
* Characters (ASCII, Unicode)

---

### 5. **Memory Hierarchy**

* Registers
* Cache (L1, L2, L3)
* Main Memory (RAM)
* Secondary Storage (HDD/SSD)

---

### 6. **Assembly Language Basics**

* Instruction format
* Opcodes and operands
* Addressing Modes

---

### 7. **Control Unit**

* Hardwired vs Microprogrammed
* Instruction decoding

---

### 8. **Pipelining**

* Stages (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB)
* Hazards (Structural, Data, Control)
* Solutions (Forwarding, Stalling)

---

### 9. **Input/Output Systems**
