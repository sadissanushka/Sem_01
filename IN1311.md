| Input (A) | Output (A') |
| --------- | ----------- |
|     0     | 1           |
|     1     | 0           |
2. AND Gate

| A   | B   | Output (A . B) |
| --- | --- | -------------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0              |
| 0   | 1   | 0              |
| 1   | 0   | 0              |
| 1   | 1   | 1              |

3. OR Gate

| A   | B   | Output (A + B) |
| --- | --- | -------------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0              |
| 0   | 1   | 1              |
| 1   | 0   | 1              |
| 1   | 1   | 1              |
4. NOR Gate

| A   | B   | Output (A + B)' |
| --- | --- | --------------- |
| 0   | 0   | 1               |
| 0   | 1   | 0               |
| 1   | 0   | 0               |
| 1   | 1   | 0               |

5. NAND Gate
