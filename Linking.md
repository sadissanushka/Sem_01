Here's an **Obsidian-style note** on the **Linking** step in the compilation process, complete with emojis for clarity and memorability:

---

## 🔗 Linking (Step 4 of Compilation)

### 🧠 What is Linking?

**Linking** is the final step in the compilation process.
It **combines multiple object files and libraries** into a single **executable file**.

---

### 🛠️ What Does a Linker Do?

1. 🧱 **Combines Object Files**

   * Merges `.o` files created from different source files
   * Example: `main.o + utils.o → final program`

2. 🔗 **Resolves Symbol References**

   * Links function and variable references across files
   * Example: Connects a call to `printf()` with its definition in the standard library

3. 📚 **Includes Library Code**

   * Statically links standard or user-defined libraries
   * Example:

     * C standard library (`libc`)
     * Math library (`libm`)

4. 🚫 **Reports Errors if Needed**

   * If something is missing (e.g., undefined function), the linker throws an error like:

     ```
     undefined reference to 'someFunction'
     ```

### 📄 Input & Output

| 🔄 Step     | 📂 Input          | 📄 Output                                      |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Linking** | `.o` files + libs | Executable (e.g., `.exe`, `a.out`, ELF binary) |

---

### 🧪 Example

Let's say you have:

```bash
gcc main.c helper.c -o myprogram
```

🔽 Under the hood:

1. `main.c` ➡️ `main.o`
2. `helper.c` ➡️ `helper.o`
3. `main.o + helper.o + stdlibs` ➡️ `myprogram` ✅

### 🧭 Types of Linking

| Type               | Description                      | Example                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Static Linking  | Copies all code into executable  | Bigger file, no external deps    |
| 🔄 Dynamic Linking | Uses shared libraries at runtime | Smaller file, needs `.dll`/`.so` |

---

### ⚠️ Common Linker Errors

* `undefined reference to 'functionName'`
  ➡️ Usually means a function was declared but never defined or linked
