## 💾 RAM – Random Access Memory


---

### 🔍 Definition

**RAM (Random Access Memory)** is a type of volatile memory that temporarily stores data and instructions the CPU needs while performing tasks. It is faster than storage but loses its content when the power is turned off.

---

### 🧠 Key Characteristics

* ⚡ **Volatile** – Data is lost when power is off.
* 🚀 **High-Speed** – Faster than HDD/SSD.
* 🔄 **Random Access** – Any memory cell can be accessed directly.
* 🧹 **Temporary** – Used for current operations, not long-term storage.

### 🧩 Types of RAM

#### 📗 1. **SRAM (Static RAM)**

* ✅ Faster
* 🔋 Consumes more power
* 💰 Expensive
* 📦 Used in **cache memory**

#### 📘 2. **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**

* 🔄 Needs to be refreshed periodically
* 🐢 Slower than SRAM
* 💸 Cheaper
* 🖥️ Used as **main memory**

### 🧮 DDR Generations (for DRAM)

| Generation | Speed           | Voltage | Common Use              |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| DDR        | \~200 MHz       | 2.5V    | Legacy systems          |
| DDR2       | \~400–800 MHz   | 1.8V    | Older PCs               |
| DDR3       | \~800–1600 MHz  | 1.5V    | Common in older PCs     |
| DDR4       | \~1600–3200 MHz | 1.2V    | Most current systems    |
| DDR5       | \~4800+ MHz     | 1.1V    | High-end modern systems |

### 📤 Role in the Computing System

* 🏃 Holds the **OS, active programs, and data in use**
* ⌛ Reduces CPU wait times by offering quick access
* 🔁 Works in coordination with **cache** and **virtual memory**

### 🧠 RAM vs ROM

| Feature    | RAM 💾                 | ROM 📕                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Volatility | Volatile               | Non-volatile            |
| Writable   | Yes (read/write)       | No (read-only, usually) |
| Speed      | Fast                   | Slower                  |
| Usage      | Temporary data storage | Firmware, BIOS          |
