## 📕 ROM & Disk Storage

📚 _IN1321 - Computer Organization_

---

### 📕 ROM – Read-Only Memory

#### 🔍 Definition

**ROM (Read-Only Memory)** is a type of **non-volatile** memory that stores **permanent instructions or data**, typically needed during **booting** or **hardware initialization**.

---

### 🧠 Key Characteristics

- 🔒 **Non-volatile** – Retains data without power
    
- ❌ **Read-only** – Cannot be modified (easily)
    
- ⚙️ **Pre-programmed** – Stores firmware or BIOS
    
- 📦 **Used in**: Motherboards, embedded systems

### 🧩 Types of ROM

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|🧾 ROM|Pre-written during manufacturing|
|📝 PROM|Programmable once by the user|
|🔁 EPROM|Erasable using UV light; then reprogrammable|
|💡 EEPROM|Electrically erasable and reprogrammable (slow)|
|🔌 Flash|Fast EEPROM used in SSDs, USB drives, etc.|

---

### 💽 Disk Storage (Secondary Storage)

#### 🔍 Definition

**Disk storage** refers to non-volatile devices used for **long-term data storage**, such as **Hard Disk Drives (HDD)** and **Solid-State Drives (SSD)**.

---

### 🧱 Types of Disk Storage

#### 🌀 1. **HDD – Hard Disk Drive**

- 🧲 Magnetic storage
    
- 🐢 Slower read/write speed
    
- 💰 Cheaper per GB
    
- 🔊 Mechanical, can make noise
    

#### ⚡ 2. **SSD – Solid-State Drive**

- ⚡ Flash memory (like fast EEPROM)
    
- 🚀 Fast read/write speeds
    
- 🧏 Silent, no moving parts
    
- 💵 More expensive per GB

### 🔁 Comparison Table

|Feature|ROM 📕|Disk Storage 💽|
|---|---|---|
|Volatility|Non-volatile|Non-volatile|
|Speed|Very Fast (but small)|Moderate to Fast|
|Use|Firmware, BIOS|File storage, OS, apps|
|Access Type|Sequential/Random|Random|
|Capacity|Few KB–MB|GBs to TBs|

### 📝 Notes

```markdown
- [ ] Understand boot process: ROM → RAM → OS from Disk
- [ ] Difference between firmware (ROM) and OS (Disk)
- [ ] Diagram: Memory & Storage hierarchy
```

Would you like a **diagram** or **visual layout** for this memory/storage hierarchy? I can create one with markdown blocks or images.
