There are **two main types of relative clauses** in English:

---

## 🔍 **1. Defining Relative Clauses** (a.k.a. **Restrictive Clauses**)

### ✅ **What they do:**

Give **essential** information to identify the noun.  
Without this clause, the sentence’s meaning is incomplete or unclear.

### 🧩 **Common relative pronouns:**

`who, which, that, whose, where, when`

### 🧾 **Examples**
- 🔹 _The student **who won the award** is my friend._  
    👉 (Tells us **which** student.)
    
- 🔹 _This is the book **that I told you about**._
    

### ⚠️ Notes:

- **No commas** used.
    
- You **can’t remove** the clause without changing the meaning.

## 💬 **2. Non-Defining Relative Clauses** (a.k.a. **Non-Restrictive Clauses**)

### ✅ **What they do:**

Give **extra** or **additional** information.  
You can remove the clause and the sentence still makes sense.

### 🧩 **Common relative pronouns:**

`who, which, whose, where, when` (⚠️ **never use “that”**)

### 🧾 **Examples:**

- 🔹 _My brother, **who lives in Canada**, is a software engineer._
    
- 🔹 _The Eiffel Tower, **which was built in 1889**, is in Paris._
    

### ⚠️ Notes:

- **Commas are used.**
    
- Clause is **optional** (just adds detail).
