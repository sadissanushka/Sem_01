## 🖥️ Computer Functions

📚 _IN1321 – Computer Organization_

---

### 🧠 A computer performs 4 fundamental operations, which enable it to receive, process, store, and transmit data efficiently.

---

### ⚙️ 1. **Data Processing**

- 🔄 Involves **manipulating data** according to instructions.
    
- 🧮 Performed mainly by the **CPU** (Arithmetic Logic Unit & Control Unit).
    
- 🧾 Examples:
    
    - Calculating sums
        
    - Comparing values
        
    - Executing logic operations
        

> 🔹 _The brain of the computer performs processing by executing instructions on data._

---

### 💾 2. **Data Storage**

- 🧷 Refers to **storing data and instructions** for immediate or future use.
    
- 🧠 Two main types:
    
    - 🧊 **Primary Storage** – RAM, Cache (fast, temporary)
        
    - 🗄️ **Secondary Storage** – HDD, SSD (permanent)
        

> 🔹 _Enables the system to retain information during and after processing._

---

### 🔀 3. **Data Movement**

- 🚚 Involves **transferring data** between components or devices.
    
- 🔗 Uses **buses** (Data, Address, Control) and interfaces.
    
- 🔁 Internal Movement: CPU ↔ RAM
    
- 🌐 External Movement: CPU ↔![[Pasted image 20250603122922.png]] I/O Devices, Network
    

> 🔹 _All parts of a computer must communicate to complete a task._

---

### 🕹️ 4. **Control**

- 🎮 Manages the **execution of instructions**.
    
- 📢 Coordinates the operations of all components.
    
- 🧠 Performed by the **Control Unit** within the CPU.
    
- 📍 Determines the sequence of data processing steps.
    

> 🔹 _Acts like a traffic controller, ensuring correct data flow and timing._

|Function|Role|Responsible Unit|
|---|---|---|
|⚙️ Processing|Compute, calculate|CPU (ALU)|
|💾 Storage|Store data & instructions|RAM, ROM, HDD, SSD|
|🔀 Movement|Transfer data|Buses, I/O interfaces|
|🕹️ Control|Direct & coordinate activities|Control Unit (CPU)|
