### 🧩 Types of Programming Languages

#### 1. 🛠️ **Low-Level Languages**

* 💻 **Machine Language** – Binary code (0s and 1s)
* 🧬 **Assembly Language** – Human-readable mnemonics

#### 2. 🚀 **High-Level Languages**

* 🧑‍💻 Easier to read, write, and maintain
* Examples:

  * 🐍 Python
  * ☕ Java
  * 🧱 C++
  * 🌐 JavaScript

### 🔁 [[Compiled vs Interpreted]]

| Type            | Description 📝             | Examples 🧪      |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 🧰 Compiled     | Translates code before run | C, C++, Rust     |
| 🎙️ Interpreted | Translates code at runtime | Python, JS, Ruby |
